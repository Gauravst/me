    <h1>Everyone Against Hindus</h1>
    <p>Every country,</p>
    <p>Every major religion,</p>
    <p>All against Hindus.</p>

    <p>What is happening to Bangladeshi Hindus, you don’t know...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The government bans Hindu icons there.</li>
      <li>No one is talking about it.</li>
      <li>Even Hindus are not talking about it.</li>
      <li>No one is protesting in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But when the Pakistani Muslim government, some days ago, opened fire on
      its own Muslim people, protests happened in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you post images of Muslims killed in Gaza, YouTube, Facebook, and
      Instagram have no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you post a picture of a destroyed temple from Bangladesh, YouTube
      will take down your video.
    </p>

    <p>You don’t know what is happening inside India...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are some national-level political Muslim parties. They openly say
        that if police are removed for 15 minutes, they will do things I can’t
        mention here.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recent Events</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Recently, in Canada, an attack happened on a Hindu temple, and Canadian
        police stopped Hindus from fighting back. But they do not stop
        Khalistanis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some time ago, Iran’s supreme leader said, “Indian Muslims are in the
        same condition as Gaza Muslims.” Do you think this is true? And if so,
        how much?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Global Criticism</h2>
    <p>So-called Great Britain has a problem with Hindus and Indians.</p>
    <p>
      The whole EU almost has a problem because India does not condemn Russia
      for war.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the whole world is against India, Israel and Russia stand with India.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the whole world ignores Bangladeshi Hindus, Israel stands with
      Hindus.
    </p>
    <p>Even when Hindus go against Hindus, Israel is with Hindus.</p>

    <h2>Conversions</h2>
    <p>Hindus never converted anyone to Hinduism.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Muslims do it with force.</li>
      <li>Christianity does it with money.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In India, Christians give money to convert people.</p>
    <p>Everyone is against Hindus:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hindus against Hindus</li>
      <li>Muslims against Hindus</li>
      <li>Christians against Hindus</li>
      <li>Sikhs against Hindus</li>
      <li>Buddhists against Hindus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>India's Laws</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a law in India called the "Waqf Board." This law, implemented
        by the current opposition, says that if the "Waqf Board" feels some land
        is theirs, they can take that land. The Waqf Board is a Muslim
        organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many places where Hindu gods were born, but those places now
        have Muslim mosques.
      </li>
      <li>
        In India, there is something called the Muslim Personal Law Board. This
        allows Muslims to decide how women live, how to solve family disputes,
        and how marriage, divorce, and inheritance will work. But for Hindus,
        the government makes these decisions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In India, only Hindu temples are controlled by the government, not those
      of other religions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muslims even receive subsidies and money for their religious activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Religions</h2>
    <p>
      Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism,
      and Judaism—there are 8 major religions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Islam is the second-largest religion in India, but in the world, it is
      treated as a minority.
    </p>

    <h2>Environmental Hypocrisy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When Christians cut trees for Christmas, nothing happens.</li>
      <li>
        When Muslims slaughter animals for their festivals, nothing happens.
      </li>
      <li>When wars occur, nothing happens.</li>
      <li>When people kill animals for food, nothing happens.</li>
      <li>
        But when Hindus use firecrackers during Diwali, the world complains
        about environmental harm.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some world news media try to rename Hindu festivals to sound Muslim.</p>
    <p>
      Wikipedia’s version of Indian history suppresses facts about Muslim
      invaders.
    </p>

    <p>I want to say more, but I think you will never read.</p>
